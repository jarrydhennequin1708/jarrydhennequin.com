## About etika

Founded in 2014, etika is a fintech start-up committed to making fair finance accessible to everyone. The company offers affordable, tailored financial solutions to customers, whenever and wherever they need it.

## The Challenge of Being the First Designer

As the first designer at etika, I faced the unique challenge of establishing design's role in an early-stage start-up environment. This meant working closely with various departments and balancing multiple responsibilities:

- Designing a new platform and design system
- Creating and managing a global website
- Developing the brand
- Establishing design principles
- Conducting user research

The key to success was building strong relationships across the organisation, being open to feedback, and demonstrating the value of design in achieving business goals.

## Key Projects
