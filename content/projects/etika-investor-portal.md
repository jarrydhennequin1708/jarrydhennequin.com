## Challenge

etika's loan book growth was constrained by traditional funding sources. Bank facilities and institutional investors required high minimum thresholds ($10M+), lengthy due diligence (3-6 months), and imposed restrictive covenants that limited operational flexibility.

Meanwhile, retail and accredited investors seeking yield-generating investments faced their own barriers:

1. Low savings rates of 1-2% on term deposits
2. Volatile equity markets creating uncertainty
3. High barriers to entry for alternative investments
4. Limited transparency into asset performance

The opportunity was to create a direct investment channel that would diversify etika's funding base while giving investors access to consumer lending yields without fund manager fees.

## Approach

I led the end-to-end product design for the investor portal, working closely with legal, compliance, and engineering teams:

**Discovery and regulatory mapping**

- Mapped ASIC requirements for managed investment schemes and regulatory sandbox pathways
- Defined KYC/AML verification flows compliant with AML/CTF Act requirements
- Designed investor classification system for retail, sophisticated, and institutional investors
- Created risk disclosure frameworks aligned with Corporations Act requirements

**Collaboration with blockchain consultants**

- Translated token economics requirements from blockchain consultants into user-facing experiences
- Designed UI patterns that communicate yield structures and token mechanics clearly to investors
- Created information architecture that balances transparency with regulatory disclosure requirements

**Platform architecture**

- Multi-stage onboarding flow from registration through KYC to first investment
- Real-time portfolio dashboard with loan book performance metrics
- Token management system for purchases, yield tracking, and redemptions

## Solution

The platform enables qualified investors to participate in etika's loan book through three core experiences:

**Streamlined onboarding**
Progressive registration flow that captures investor details, verifies identity through document upload and liveness checks, links bank accounts, and classifies investor type—all while maintaining compliance with Australian financial regulations.

**Investment configuration**
Clear investment selection with amount tiers ($10K-$2M), term options (1-4 years), and real-time yield calculations. Investors see projected returns, maturity dates, and receive ETIKA tokens representing their loan book participation.

**Portfolio management**
Comprehensive dashboard showing total portfolio value, unrealised gains, and investment status. Loan book health metrics provide transparency into delinquency rates, sector allocation, and product breakdown—giving investors confidence in their holdings.

## Outcomes

The project delivered a complete investment platform design ready for regulatory approval:

- **Yield rates of 2.56-5.00%** depending on investment amount and term, significantly above term deposit rates
- **70% of loan book funded** with soft credit checks, protecting underlying borrower credit scores
- **94.2% loan book health score** with transparent performance metrics visible to all investors
- **Tiered investor rewards** encouraging larger, longer-term investments through yield bonuses

The platform demonstrates how blockchain tokenisation can democratise access to alternative investments while maintaining regulatory compliance and operational transparency—turning etika's loan book into an accessible yield-generating asset class.
