## Challenge

Monash University's research office faced a critical problem: identifying where to invest limited research funding for maximum impact. Business development representatives were drowning in data from thousands of scholarly publications, grants, and funding bodies—with no systematic way to spot emerging opportunities or gaps in the market.

The university needed a tool that could:

1. Surface trending research areas before they become saturated
2. Identify underfunded disciplines with high commercial or societal potential
3. Present complex bibliometric data in a way non-technical staff could act on
4. Scale across multiple institutions as a white-label product

## Approach

Working directly with Monash's research office, I led the product design from initial concept through to funded rollout:

**Discovery and definition**

- Shadowed business development representatives to understand their decision-making process
- Mapped the existing workflow and identified key friction points
- Conducted competitor analysis across academic intelligence platforms

**Rapid prototyping**

- Created low-fidelity concepts exploring different mental models for research discovery
- Tested interactive prototypes with target users to validate core features
- Iterated on data visualisation approaches until complex relationships became intuitive

**Design system and handoff**

- Developed a scalable component library with white-labelling in mind
- Collaborated with the engineering team on technical constraints and API limitations
- Created detailed specifications for AI-generated insights and recommendations

## Solution

The final product enables research staff to explore funding landscapes through three core features:

**Trend radar**
An interactive visualisation showing emerging research topics, mapped by velocity of growth and current funding saturation. Users can drill down into specific disciplines to see granular trends.

**Opportunity scoring**
AI-powered recommendations that surface underfunded areas aligned with the university's strategic priorities. Each opportunity includes confidence scores and supporting evidence.

**Competitive intelligence**
Benchmarking tools showing how Monash's research output compares to peer institutions, helping identify areas of competitive advantage or strategic gaps.

## Outcomes

The project delivered measurable impact:

- **Secured national funding** for white-label rollout across Australian research institutions
- **Reduced research time** for business development reps from days to hours when identifying new opportunities
- **Increased confidence** in investment decisions through data-driven evidence
- **Positioned Monash** as a leader in research intelligence, opening potential commercialisation revenue streams

The platform demonstrates how thoughtful product design can make AI capabilities accessible to non-technical users—turning complex data into actionable insights that drive real institutional outcomes.
