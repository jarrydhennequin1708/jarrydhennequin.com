## The Problem

ANZ Bank's risk team had a data problem—but not the one you'd expect.

Their 16 Business Intelligence dashboards held critical risk data worth billions in potential exposure. The problem? Only 30 specialists across the entire organisation could actually use them. The tools were powerful but impenetrable, creating dangerous knowledge silos and bottlenecks that slowed decision-making across the bank.

When risk insights take too long to surface, bad decisions get made. ANZ needed their dashboards to work for hundreds of users, not just a handful of experts.

## The Approach

I led a 10-week design transformation as the UX designer and design sprint facilitator, working directly with risk analysts across Australia and New Zealand.

**Week 1-3: Understanding the Real Problem**

I shadowed 24 users in their actual work environment—watching them struggle with multi-step workarounds, manual data exports, and endless Slack threads trying to share findings. The dashboards weren't broken; they were built for a different user entirely.

**Week 4-7: Rapid Solution Design**

Through collaborative design sprints, we tackled the four biggest friction points:
- Data comparison required opening multiple browser tabs
- Filtering meant memorising complex parameter combinations
- Sharing insights involved screenshots and email chains
- Returning to useful views meant recreating the entire query

**Opportunity Mapping**

We used affinity mapping to categorise and prioritise opportunities across key areas: filtering, search, commentary, personalisation, dashboard design, information architecture, and more.

**Week 8-10: Validation and Handoff**

Interactive prototypes went through three rounds of user testing, with each iteration informed by real feedback from the people who'd use these tools daily.

## The Solution

We introduced six core capabilities that fundamentally changed how ANZ's teams work with risk data.

### Main Dashboard

The redesigned dashboard surfaces key metrics at a glance—Total RWA, Gross Lending Assets, Risk Density, and Capital Adequacy Ratio—with drill-down into industry breakdowns and trend analysis.

### Geographic Distribution

A new map visualisation shows risk exposure by region, allowing analysts to quickly identify geographic concentrations and outliers.

### Data Explorer

Custom chart builder lets users create their own visualisations—bar charts, line charts, scatter plots, and heatmaps—comparing metrics across any dimension.

### Smart Filtering

50+ filter options organised into logical groups—time period, geography, industry—with active filter chips and instant results. What took 15 clicks now takes 2.

### Metrics Library

A comprehensive library of risk metrics with definitions, current values, and trends. Users can browse by category and add any metric to their favourites.

### Collaboration Features

In-app commenting replaced the screenshot-and-explain workflow. Team members can tag colleagues, reference specific data points, and track discussions—all within context.

### Reports & Exports

One-click export to PDF, Excel, or email. Scheduled reports run automatically and land in stakeholders' inboxes without manual intervention.

### Saved Views

Frequently accessed analyses saved for instant recall. Personal views, shared views, and team views keep everyone aligned without recreating queries.

### Dataset Switching

Easy navigation between Risk Weighted Assets, Credit Exposure, Market Risk, and Operational Risk datasets from a single interface.

## The Impact

The numbers tell the story:

- **Active users:** 30 → 300+
- **User adoption:** Specialists only → Global teams
- **Time to insight:** Hours → Minutes

Beyond the metrics, the redesign changed how ANZ thinks about risk data:

- **Democratised Access**: Risk insights now inform decisions at every level, not just within the data science team
- **Faster Response**: When market conditions shift, more people can interrogate the data and respond appropriately
- **Reduced Bottlenecks**: Specialists spend less time pulling reports for colleagues and more time on high-value analysis

This project demonstrated that enterprise BI tools don't have to be expert-only. With the right research and design approach, complex data can become accessible to everyone who needs it—without sacrificing analytical power.
