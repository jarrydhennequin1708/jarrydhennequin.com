## Challenge

Services Australia, the nation's primary social services provider, faced significant challenges with its outdated portal:

1. The system hadn't been updated in a decade, leading to numerous usability issues.
2. Customer frustration was high, often resulting in unintended debt accumulation (the "robodebt" crisis).
3. The need to not only fix existing problems but also innovate with new, forward-thinking solutions.
4. Ensuring accessibility for a diverse user base with varying needs and abilities.

## Approach

We implemented a comprehensive, user-centred design process:

1. **In-depth Discovery**:Shadowed Services Australia employees across various centres in Australia.
2. Conducted interviews with diverse Services Australia recipients to understand their needs and pain points.
3. **Iterative Design Sprints**:Identified the riskiest assumptions at the start of each week.
4. Utilised design sprint methodology to rapidly create and validate new solutions with users.
5. **Accessibility-Focused Design System**:Developed a robust design system achieving AAA accessibility rating.
6. Created new components with a focus on universal usability.
7. **Continuous Validation**:Regularly tested new concepts and iterations with end-users to ensure effectiveness.

## Opportunties

1. **User-Centric Portal Redesign**: Overhauled the entire user interface based on real user needs and feedback.
2. **Debt Prevention Features**: Implemented clear communication and proactive notifications to help users avoid unintended debt accumulation.
3. **Accessibility Integration**: Ensured that all new features and designs met the highest accessibility standards (AAA rating).
4. **Flexible Design System**: Created a scalable system that allows for consistent growth and updates across the portal.
5. **Blue Sky Concepts**: Developed and tested innovative ideas to push the boundaries of social service delivery.

## Outcomes and Impact

The project has yielded significant positive results:

1. **Digital Transformation Catalyst**: This project kickstarted the Department of Human Services' broader digital transformation initiative.
2. **Financial Success**: Became Fjord's most lucrative project to date, demonstrating the value of user-centred design in government services.
3. **Improved User Experience**: Significantly reduced user frustration and improved the overall experience of interacting with Services Australia's services.
4. **Debt Reduction**: Early indicators suggest a decrease in unintended debt accumulation among users.
5. **Scalable Solution**: The new design system has enabled consistent and continuous growth of the Services Australia portal.
6. **Enhanced Accessibility**: Achieved AAA accessibility rating, ensuring that Services Australia's services are usable by all Australians, regardless of ability.

This project showcases how user-centred design and iterative development can transform critical government services. By deeply understanding user needs, rapidly prototyping solutions, and maintaining a focus on accessibility, we were able to modernise Services Australia's digital presence.

The resulting system not only addresses current pain points but also provides a flexible foundation for future innovations in social service delivery. This transformation sets a new standard for digital government services in Australia and demonstrates the power of design in improving citizens' lives.
