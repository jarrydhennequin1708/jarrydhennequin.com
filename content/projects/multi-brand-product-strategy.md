## Challenge

Big Red Group operates Australia's leading experience gifting platforms: Red Balloon, ExperienceOz, and Adrenaline. Despite strong brand recognition, the digital products were underperforming against their potential.

The core problems:

1. **Low conversion** from product pages to cart—users were browsing but not booking
2. **Traffic concentration** with 15% of experiences capturing the majority of page views
3. **Availability blindness** where users couldn't easily see when experiences were actually available
4. **Fragmented design** across three brands with no shared system or component library
5. **SEO risk** from any information architecture changes to high-ranking pages
6. **Knowledge loss** from high staff turnover affecting design continuity

## Approach

As UX lead, I developed a strategy that addressed both immediate conversion issues and long-term scalability:

**Research and analysis**
- Analysed user behaviour data to map drop-off points in the booking funnel
- Conducted usability testing on existing product detail pages
- Audited competitor experiences and industry best practices

**Design system architecture**
- Created a token-based design system supporting three distinct brand identities
- Designed components that flex across web, iOS, and Android
- Built documentation that survives team changes

**Conversion optimisation**
- Redesigned the product detail page to surface availability upfront
- Streamlined the booking flow from 5 steps to 3
- Improved search and filtering to distribute traffic across the experience catalogue

## Solution

The redesigned platform introduced several key features:

**Availability-first product pages**
Interactive calendars showing real-time availability directly on the product page, eliminating the guesswork that caused users to abandon before booking.

**Enhanced experience details**
Rich content modules covering what to expect, what's included, and day-of logistics—answering questions before users need to ask.

**Smart search distribution**
Algorithm improvements that surface a broader range of experiences, reducing the long-tail problem and increasing discovery of lesser-known products.

**Multi-brand design system**
A flexible component library using design tokens to maintain brand distinction while sharing underlying patterns. Red Balloon feels warm and gifting-focused; Adrenaline feels bold and action-oriented—built from the same system.

## Outcomes

The ExperienceOz relaunch delivered measurable results:

- **Zero SEO regression** despite significant information architecture changes
- **Increased conversion** from product page to cart in the first quarter post-launch
- **Broader traffic distribution** across the experience catalogue
- **Reduced design/dev time** for new features through component reuse

The design system now powers ongoing development across all three BRG brands, providing:

**For users:** Consistent, intuitive experiences regardless of which brand they're shopping
**For the business:** Faster time-to-market for new features and campaigns
**For the team:** Shared language and patterns that accelerate onboarding and reduce design debt

This project demonstrates how systematic design thinking can unlock growth in mature e-commerce businesses—not through flashy redesigns, but through careful attention to user needs and operational efficiency.
