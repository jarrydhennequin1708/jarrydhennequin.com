## Challenge

When I joined etika in 2019 as their first designer, the company needed a professional web presence that could scale across multiple markets. The existing site was developer-maintained, creating a bottleneck where every copy change or new landing page required engineering time—time better spent on core product development.

The business needed:

1. A website that could launch across Australia, New Zealand, and the UK with localised content
2. Marketing autonomy to publish blog posts and adjust landing page copy without developer involvement
3. Rapid landing page creation for campaigns, partner launches, and new product offerings
4. Lead capture integrated with existing sales and marketing tools

## Approach

I led the design process in close collaboration with marketing and technology stakeholders, taking the project from concept through to launch and ongoing management.

**Discovery and stakeholder alignment**

- Workshopped requirements with marketing to understand content needs and campaign frequency
- Consulted with the technology team on integration requirements and handoff expectations
- Audited competitor fintech websites to establish design benchmarks
- Defined information architecture for three distinct audiences: customers, merchants, and investors

**Design and build**

- Selected Webflow as the platform for its balance of design flexibility and content management capability
- Used Relume's component library as the foundation, customising styles to match etika's brand
- Built a modular page structure that marketing could reconfigure without touching code
- Created responsive designs optimised for mobile-first browsing

**Integration architecture**

- Connected form submissions to Salesforce CRM via Make.com automation
- Integrated email capture with Mailchimp for nurture campaigns
- Built tracking for conversion attribution across marketing channels

## Solution

The website served three distinct user journeys through dedicated sections:

**Customer-facing pages**
Clear explanation of etika's buy-now-pay-later offering with loan calculators, eligibility information, and a streamlined application entry point. Messaging focused on responsible lending and transparent terms.

**Merchant acquisition pages**
B2B landing pages targeting retailers with integration information, conversion statistics, and partner logos. Sector-specific pages for furniture, electronics, and healthcare highlighted relevant use cases.

**Investor portal**
Dedicated section for etika's unique retail investment product, explaining yield-bearing notes and the company's regulated structure.

The Relume-based component system meant new landing pages could be assembled in days rather than weeks. When marketing needed a campaign page for a partner launch or seasonal promotion, I could build, review, and publish within the same week.

## Empowering the Marketing Team

A key outcome was enabling collaborative content management:

- **Blog management**: Marketing could publish, edit, and schedule blog posts through Webflow's CMS without any design or developer involvement
- **Copy updates**: Landing page text, CTAs, and promotional messaging could be adjusted directly by the marketing team
- **Image updates**: Asset swaps for campaigns and seasonal content handled independently
- **Form management**: New lead capture forms deployed and connected to Salesforce workflows

This self-service capability freed the development team to focus entirely on etika's core lending platform while maintaining a professional, regularly-updated marketing presence.

## Outcomes

Over nearly three years of management, the website delivered consistent value:

- **Three-market launch**: Successfully deployed localised versions for Australia, New Zealand, and the UK
- **Developer time reclaimed**: Removed website maintenance from engineering backlog entirely
- **Rapid campaign support**: New landing pages delivered in days, not weeks
- **Lead pipeline integration**: Automated flow from web form to Salesforce to Mailchimp nurture sequences
- **Marketing autonomy**: Team independently managed blog content and landing page copy

The project demonstrated how thoughtful no-code architecture can bridge the gap between marketing needs and technical resources—giving business teams the autonomy they need while protecting engineering focus for core product development.
