## Challenge

Barwon Water, a major water utility provider, faced several operational challenges that were impacting service delivery and internal efficiency:

1. Lack of documented processes across multiple departments
2. Siloed operations hindering cross-functional collaboration
3. Outdated systems and minimal automation
4. Dissatisfied internal customers due to inefficient service delivery
5. Limited understanding of experience design processes within the organisation

## Approach

As the lead of a small team, we implemented a comprehensive strategy to address these challenges:

1. **Service Mapping**: Conducted a thorough mapping of Barwon Water's entire service experience across all departments and visualised the complete service to provide a holistic view of operations.
2. **Prioritisation**: Identified and focused on the most significant problem areas with the highest impact on customer satisfaction and organisational value.
3. **Stakeholder Engagement**: Organised a series of remote and in-person workshops to gather detailed information about services and educated teams about the experience design process to ensure buy-in.
4. **Deep Dive Analysis**: Conducted an in-depth examination of one prioritised service to expose processes and uncover problems and opportunities.
5. **Opportunity Identification**: Explored possibilities for introducing modern applications to streamline project execution, management, customer communication, and document creation.

## Deliverables

1. **Holistic Service Visualisation**: Created a comprehensive map of Barwon Water's services, providing unprecedented visibility into cross-departmental operations.
2. **Process Documentation**: Established clear documentation for previously undocumented processes, creating a foundation for future improvements.
3. **Inter-departmental Collaboration**: Facilitated workshops that brought together previously siloed departments, fostering a culture of cooperation.
4. **Modernisation Roadmap**: Developed proposals for integrating newer, more efficient applications to replace outdated systems.
5. **Quick-win Optimisations**: Identified and implemented immediate process improvements that could be actioned without significant resource investment.

## Outcomes and Impact

The project delivered tangible results across multiple departments:

1. **Project Management Transformation**: The environmental teams adopted a holistic project management tool, enabling better coordination across complex multi-stakeholder projects and improving visibility into project status and resource allocation.
2. **CRM Implementation**: The strategic property team introduced a CRM system to manage lead relationships, streamlining their pipeline management and improving follow-up processes with potential partners and stakeholders.
3. **Enhanced Visibility**: The holistic service map provided unprecedented insight into Barwon Water's operations, enabling more informed decision-making across the organisation.
4. **Cross-departmental Collaboration**: Previously siloed teams discovered shared pain points and implemented quick-win optimisations together.
5. **Cultural Shift**: Increased understanding and appreciation of experience design processes within the organisation, establishing a foundation for continuous improvement.

This project demonstrates the value of service mapping as a catalyst for change. By visualising the entire service experience and facilitating cross-departmental conversations, we helped teams identify the right tools to address their specific challenges—leading to lasting operational improvements.
