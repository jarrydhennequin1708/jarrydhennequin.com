## Challenge

etika's buy-now-pay-later service faced a critical problem with high-value purchases over $2,000: every credit application required a hard credit check that damaged customer credit scores, cost $3-5 per enquiry, and created anxiety that caused cart abandonment.

The existing process had multiple pain points:

1. Hard checks appearing on credit files for 5 years, penalising customers who were declined
2. Manual underwriting taking 24-48 hours, killing conversion on big-ticket items
3. Borderline applicants—thin credit files, recent immigrants, variable income—getting declined without recourse
4. Inconsistent decision-making across underwriters creating compliance risk

## Approach

Working directly with etika's credit operations team, I led the product design from initial concept through to pilot:

**Discovery and definition**

- Mapped the existing credit assessment workflow and identified key friction points
- Interviewed underwriters to understand decision-making patterns and edge cases
- Analysed decline reasons to identify customers who could be approved with additional information
- Reviewed regulatory requirements for responsible lending under NCCP Act

**System architecture**

- Designed a multi-stage assessment flow that starts soft and only escalates when necessary
- Created decision logic that routes applications based on risk scoring thresholds
- Built document upload pathways for borderline applicants to strengthen their case
- Integrated with Equifax and Illion for soft credit enquiries

**Two-sided platform design**

- Customer-facing portal for transparent status tracking and document upload
- Underwriter dashboard with AI-assisted decision support and queue management
- Automated notification system keeping customers informed throughout

## Solution

The platform enables responsible credit assessment through three core capabilities:

**Soft credit check engine**
AI-powered risk scoring using soft bureau enquiries that don't impact customer credit scores. Customers can apply without fear of damage, and etika gets comprehensive risk assessment within 15 seconds.

**Progressive assessment flow**
Multi-stage pipeline that auto-approves low-risk applications instantly, offers document upload for borderline cases, and only escalates to hard checks when absolutely necessary—with explicit customer consent and withdrawal options.

**Document verification portal**
Customer-facing upload system for payslips, bank statements, and employment letters. OCR extraction and AI fraud detection automate verification, reducing underwriter workload while giving customers agency over their application.

## Outcomes

The project delivered measurable impact:

- **57% reduction in credit bureau costs** through soft-check-first approach ($3.50 → $1.50 per application)
- **65% auto-decision rate** on high-value applications, up from 0% manual review
- **70% of applications resolved with soft checks only**, protecting customer credit scores
- **20 percentage point increase** in high-value checkout conversion (55% → 75%)

The platform demonstrates how thoughtful product design can balance business efficiency with customer protection—using AI to make faster, fairer credit decisions while giving customers control over their data and transparency into the process.
