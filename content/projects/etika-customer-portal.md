## Challenge

etika needed a customer-facing platform that could compete with established BNPL providers while handling the complexity of high-value purchases over $2,000. The existing checkout experience was fragmented across multiple systems, leading to high abandonment rates and poor customer visibility into their obligations.

Key problems to solve:

1. Checkout friction causing 40% abandonment during identity verification steps
2. No self-service portal for customers to view payment schedules or manage their accounts
3. Manual processes for handling payment changes, deferrals, and hardship requests
4. Compliance burden requiring careful disclosure of credit terms and responsible lending obligations

The challenge was to create a seamless mobile experience that made complex financial products feel simple while meeting NCCP Act requirements for responsible lending.

## Approach

I led the product design for the customer portal and loan application flow, working closely with compliance, engineering, and customer service teams:

**Discovery and regulatory mapping**

- Mapped Credit Reporting Act 2014 requirements for credit enquiries and disclosures
- Designed tiered consent flows for soft checks (no impact) versus hard checks (credit file impact)
- Created progressive disclosure patterns that surface the right information at the right time
- Integrated with Equifax and Illion APIs for real-time credit assessment

**Mobile-first design system**

- Built a cohesive design system with etika's brand language (teal primary, clean typography)
- Created responsive components optimised for thumb-zone interaction on mobile devices
- Designed status indicators and progress tracking for multi-stage verification flows
- Implemented accessibility standards for screen readers and high-contrast modes

**End-to-end journey design**

- Checkout integration that embeds seamlessly within merchant websites
- Identity verification combining document upload with liveness detection
- Payment plan selection with clear term breakdowns and total cost disclosure
- Post-purchase portal for managing payments, viewing statements, and requesting support

## Solution

The platform delivers a complete customer experience across three core touchpoints:

**Streamlined checkout flow**
Eight-step checkout that guides customers from signup through verification to purchase completion. Identity verification uses document scanning with AI-powered OCR, followed by face matching to prevent fraud. Progress indicators show exactly where customers are and what's needed to proceed.

**Smart credit assessment**
For high-value purchases, a multi-stage assessment starts with soft credit checks that don't impact the customer's credit score. Borderline applicants can strengthen their case by uploading income proof or bank statements. Hard checks only occur with explicit consent and clear disclosure of credit file impact.

**Self-service customer portal**
Comprehensive account management where customers view upcoming payments, transaction history, and remaining credit. Payment scheduling, deferral requests, and early repayment options are all available without calling support. Hardship pathways provide dignified options for customers experiencing financial difficulty.

## Outcomes

The project delivered measurable improvements to customer experience and business metrics:

- **60% reduction in checkout abandonment** through streamlined verification and clear progress indicators
- **30-second average decision time** for auto-approved applications using soft credit checks
- **85% self-service resolution rate** for common account queries, reducing support ticket volume
- **70% of credit assessments resolved with soft checks only**, protecting customer credit scores

The platform demonstrates how thoughtful UX design can make complex financial products accessible while maintaining the transparency and compliance required in Australian credit markets.
