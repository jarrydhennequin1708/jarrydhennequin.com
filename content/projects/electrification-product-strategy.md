## Challenge

AGL, a leading energy retailer in Australia, aimed to become the country's preferred home electrification provider. However, they faced several obstacles:

1. A complex and overwhelming customer journey in researching and adopting home electrification solutions.
2. A trust deficit in the industry, leading customers to seek unbiased sources.
3. Difficulty calculating and communicating potential savings to customers.
4. Challenges in attracting and retaining skilled installers due to physical demands and administrative burdens.
5. The need to create a scalable, profitable business model that satisfies both customers and installers.

## Approach

To address these challenges, we implemented a comprehensive strategy:

1. **In-depth User Research**: Conducted qualitative interviews and validation sessions with 15 customers and 16 installers across three sprints.
2. **Collaborative Workshops**: Facilitated ideation sessions with AGL and Oliver Wyman to develop ideas, features, and service concepts.
3. **Business and Technology Analysis**: Estimated capabilities across four illustrative tech suites to understand implementation requirements.
4. **Mindset Segmentation**: Developed customer and installer mindsets to better understand motivations and attitudes beyond demographics.
5. **Business Model Exploration**: Investigated three potential business models (Franchise, Subcontractor, and Challenger) to find the most desirable and viable option.
6. **Service Blueprint Creation**: Developed a comprehensive service blueprint outlining future journeys for both customers and installers.

## Opportunities

1. **Hybrid Business Model**: Conceptualised a potential hybrid model combining elements of a challenger platform with franchise-like features as local scale is achieved.
2. **Personalised Customer Journey**: Designed a journey featuring digital home electrification consultants, customer experience managers, and installer profiles to build trust and personalisation.
3. **Installer Support System**: Developed concepts for training resources, business coaching, and flexible job selection to address installer pain points.
