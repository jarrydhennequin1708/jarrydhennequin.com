## The $20 Million Problem

Origin Energy—Australia's leading electricity, gas, and solar retailer—was haemorrhaging money. One in ten electricity bills triggered disputes, each requiring expensive distributor re-reads. The annual cost: **$20 million**.

The business needed more than a band-aid. They needed a solution that would slash costs while actually improving the customer experience.

## Discovery-Led Approach

I led a structured discovery process to move from assumptions to evidence:

1. **Mapped the problem space**: Facilitated cross-functional workshops with business stakeholders to surface known pain points and hidden opportunities
2. **Generated solutions collaboratively**: Ran rapid sketching sessions with engineers and business partners, exploring concepts from OCR-powered photo submission to voice-driven data entry
3. **Built to learn**: Spun up a Formstack MVP in days—not months—and deployed it to 250 customers
4. **Let data decide**: Analysis revealed a clear winner: **95% of customers preferred photo submission** over manual entry
5. **Iterated fast**: When initial photo quality proved problematic, I refined the user guidance and ran a second experiment to validate the fix

## The Solution

The validated solution empowered customers to take control of their billing accuracy:

- **Photo-first submission**: Designed around the overwhelming user preference, customers could snap a photo of their meter instead of deciphering and typing numbers
- **Guided capture experience**: Clear, visual instructions ensured submissions were usable—reducing back-and-forth and failed readings
- **Frictionless authentication**: Streamlined identity verification to get customers to value faster
- **Fallback flexibility**: Manual entry option retained for edge cases and accessibility

## Results That Mattered

The self-meter reading feature delivered measurable business impact:

- **2,000+** customer meter readings submitted
- **$100,000+** saved in distributor re-read fees
- **95%** of users chose photo over manual entry
- **Significant decrease** in billing disputes

Beyond the numbers, this project shifted Origin's approach to customer service—proving that giving customers agency reduces friction for everyone.

## What I Delivered

This project showcases my ability to take a costly business problem and systematically de-risk a solution through:

- **Stakeholder facilitation**: Aligned engineering, operations, and customer service around a shared understanding of the problem
- **Rapid experimentation**: Validated assumptions with real customers before committing engineering resources
- **Evidence-based decision making**: Let user behaviour—not opinions—determine the product direction
- **Iterative refinement**: Identified and fixed usability issues through multiple test cycles

The success of this initiative demonstrated how user-centred discovery can transform operational headaches into competitive advantages.
