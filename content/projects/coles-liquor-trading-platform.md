## The Problem

Coles Liquor Group's Commercial Team had a spreadsheet problem that was costing them time, accuracy, and sanity.

Their promotional planning process—coordinating campaigns across Beer, Wine, Spirits, and Ready To Drink categories with dozens of suppliers—relied entirely on Excel files. These spreadsheets were:

- **Manual and error-prone**: Files corrupted regularly, versions proliferated across inboxes
- **Inflexible**: Locked to fiscal half-year periods rather than actual promotional cycles
- **Siloed**: One file per supplier, per portfolio, with zero cross-visibility
- **Costly to maintain**: Even simple changes required significant development effort

An initial platform had been built for the Beer team (25 users), but extending it to Wine, Spirits, and RTD categories meant understanding fundamentally different user needs and redesigning core workflows.

## The Approach

Working with Cognizant, I led product design and UX strategy from discovery through to validated designs ready for development.

**Discovery and research**

I conducted 16 in-depth interviews with Category Managers, Commercial Analysts, Supply Chain representatives, and platform administrators across all beverage categories.

Key questions I explored:
- How do you currently plan promotions?
- What information do you need to make decisions?
- Where do you experience friction in the current process?
- What would an ideal workflow look like?

**Findings synthesis**

Created experience heatmaps that revealed critical pain points:

- **Static date ranges tied to fiscal halves** — High impact, every planning cycle
- **No visibility across supplier portfolios** — High impact, daily friction
- **Manual file generation and distribution** — Medium impact, weekly effort
- **Inconsistent layouts across categories** — Medium impact, ongoing confusion
- **Outdated government excise data** — High impact, quarterly compliance risk

**Requirements and prototyping**

Translated user needs into functional requirements:
- Flexible date range selection (promotion-bound, not fiscal-bound)
- Multi-portfolio view for large suppliers
- Automated file generation with standardised layouts
- Real-time integration with demand forecasting
- Category-specific configurations within a unified framework

## The Solution

The platform I designed gives category managers and commercial teams a single source of truth for promotional planning across all beverage categories.

### Dashboard

A unified home screen surfaces key metrics at a glance—active promotions, pending approvals, forecast accuracy, and items requiring attention. Recent activity keeps teams aligned on what's happening across suppliers and categories.

### Dealbook

The core of promotional planning. Category managers can view and manage deals across all suppliers, grouped by price family with full visibility into costs, pricing, margins, and approval status. National versus state-level deals are clearly distinguished.

### Slotting Screen

Product ranging and slotting management showing total products, active rangings, average margins, and forecast sales. Teams can track product performance and make informed decisions about shelf allocation.

### Build Screen

Year-on-year comparison view for promotional builds. Teams can see current year performance against last year, with variance indicators highlighting growth or decline. An insights panel provides bulk numbers and clearance bucket tracking.

### Promotional Calendar

A visual timeline showing all promotions across categories—Beer, Wine, Spirits, RTD, and Cider. Colour-coded by status (approved, pending, draft) and scope (national vs state-specific), giving teams instant visibility into what's running when.

### Off-Location Planning

Dedicated view for off-location promotional placements—end caps, floor stacks, gondola ends, checkout impulse, and fridge door positions. Shows actual versus forecast performance with variance tracking.

### Marketing Nominations

Centralised management of marketing activities—TV campaigns, digital media, in-store POS, radio, and catalogue features. Track nominations, approvals, budgets, and timing across all supplier marketing investments.

### Supplier Review

Comprehensive supplier performance dashboards showing total sales, margins, promo spend, and progress against JBP (Joint Business Plan) targets. Category-level breakdowns help identify where suppliers are over or under-performing.

### Forecast Variance

Proactive exception reporting highlighting promotions where forecasts have shifted significantly. Status indicators flag critical, warning, and on-track items so teams can focus attention where it's needed most.

### Budget Maintenance

Financial oversight across all categories with budget versus actual tracking, forecast comparisons, and variance analysis. Finance teams can monitor year-to-date performance and upload updated budgets as needed.

### Design System

A scalable component library ensuring consistency across all screens—colour palette, typography, form elements, navigation patterns, buttons, status tags, cards, alerts, and icons. Built with white-labelling potential in mind.

## The Impact

The platform transformation aimed to deliver:

- **User base expansion**: 25 to 100+ users across all beverage categories
- **Planning efficiency**: Reduced manual effort through automated workflows
- **Forecast accuracy**: Improved through real-time integration with demand systems
- **Cross-category visibility**: Portfolio-level thinking enabled for the first time
- **Time to market**: Faster promotional setup and approval cycles

## Design Principles

Promotion-centric, not calendar-centric. Organise around business events, not arbitrary fiscal periods.

Cross-category visibility. Enable portfolio-level thinking for suppliers and internal teams.

Progressive disclosure. Show complexity only when needed.

Familiar patterns. Leverage existing mental models from spreadsheets to ease transition.

## Reflections

**What worked well**

Deep user research—16 interviews across different roles—revealed patterns that wouldn't emerge from smaller samples. Regular stakeholder showcases built alignment and reduced late-stage surprises. Looking beyond UI to redesign the underlying process created more impactful change.

**Challenges navigated**

Different categories had unique requirements; I balanced standardisation with flexibility. Users deeply familiar with spreadsheets needed a transition path rather than disruption. Government excise rules added constraints to date and period handling that required careful consideration.

**Key learnings**

In enterprise B2B contexts, understanding the full process (not just the interface) is crucial. Prototype-based validation sessions are more effective than specification reviews. And when replacing deeply embedded tools like Excel, the new solution needs to feel as flexible while being far more powerful.
